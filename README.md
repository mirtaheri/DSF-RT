# DSF-RT
## A simulatio tool developed to run Hybrid Simulation scenarios.
 
Hybrid Simulation tool is designed and developed to perform Hardware-In-the-Loop simulations, mainly to test the perfrmance of components before deploying in real integration. DSF-RT -RT stands for Real Time- is the simulation core that sincronizes co-simulation execution. 
DSF-RT integrates one or more physical targets into simulation execution.
